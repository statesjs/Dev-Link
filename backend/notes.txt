-----
should consider adding joi, if time allots . security and validation are pretty
high already:

mongoose schema,
helmet,
select method to hide data,
jwt encryption,
regex,
10 salt rounds on password hashing,

req.user.id from auth protected routes, or just tokenated sessions will
use reference the user mongodbid 


5/9 9:34am -



added a reference field under resources -> author to fill with the user 
mongodb id and reference the user collection for the related user, 
this is in conjuction with auth middleware to make more dynamic, strictly 
tying related PROTECTED data"

5/9 10:12am - 

refactored ALL routes to implement jwt req.user object

refactored comment model to:
- reference other collections
- created indexes for faster query

refactored user model to:
- reference other collections related
- protect sensitive info from query
- created indexes for better query times

end notes for this entry:
-should consider select options colliding, maybe have to just set false on 
the model, then only override on the routes when needed
